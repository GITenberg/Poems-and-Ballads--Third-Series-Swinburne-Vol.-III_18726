<h2>MARCH: AN ODE</h2>

<h3>1887</h3>



<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">I</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ere frost-flower and snow-blossom faded and fell, and the splendour of winter had passed out of sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ways of the woodlands were fairer and stranger than dreams that fulfil us in sleep with delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and branches that glittered and swayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow or of frost that outlightens all flowers till it fade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the sea was not lovelier than here was the land, nor the night than the day, nor the day than the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the winter sublimer with storm than the spring: such mirth had the madness and might in thee made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">March, master of winds, bright minstrel and marshal of storms that enkindle the season they smite.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p><p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">II</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now that the rage of thy rapture is satiate with revel and ravin and spoil of the snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the branches it brightened are broken, and shattered the tree-tops that only thy wrath could lay low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How should not thy lovers rejoice in thee, leader and lord of the year that exults to be born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So strong in thy strength and so glad of thy gladness whose laughter puts winter and sorrow to scorn?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast shaken the snows from thy wings, and the frost on thy forehead is molten: thy lips are aglow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a lover's that kindle with kissing, and earth, with her raiment and tresses yet wasted and torn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Takes breath as she smiles in the grasp of thy passion to feel through her spirit the sense of thee flow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">III</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fain, fain would we see but again for an hour what the wind and the sun have dispelled and consumed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those full deep swan-soft feathers of snow with whose luminous burden the branches implumed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung heavily, curved as a half-bent bow, and fledged not as birds are, but petalled as flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each tree-top and branchlet a pinnacle jewelled and carved, or a fountain that shines as it showers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fixed as a fountain is fixed not, and wrought not to last till by time or by tempest entombed,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span><span class="i0">As a pinnacle carven and gilded of men: for the date of its doom is no more than an hour's,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One hour of the sun's when the warm wind wakes him to wither the snow-flowers that froze as they bloomed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">IV</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As the sunshine quenches the snowshine; as April subdues thee, and yields up his kingdom to May;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So time overcomes the regret that is born of delight as it passes in passion away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaves but a dream for desire to rejoice in or mourn for with tears or thanksgivings; but thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright god that art gone from us, maddest and gladdest of months, to what goal hast thou gone from us now?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For somewhere surely the storm of thy laughter that lightens, the beat of thy wings that play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must flame as a fire through the world, and the heavens that we know not rejoice in thee: surely thy brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath lost not its radiance of empire, thy spirit the joy that impelled it on quest as for prey.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">V</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Are thy feet on the ways of the limitless waters, thy wings on the winds of the waste north sea?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the fires of the false north dawn over heavens where summer is stormful and strong like thee<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span><span class="i0">Now bright in the sight of thine eyes? are the bastions of icebergs assailed by the blast of thy breath?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it March with the wild north world when April is waning? the word that the changed year saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it echoed to northward with rapture of passion reiterate from spirits triumphant as we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hearts were uplift at the blast of thy clarions as men's rearisen from a sleep that was death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kindled to life that was one with the world's and with thine? hast thou set not the whole world free?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">VI</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For the breath of thy lips is freedom, and freedom's the sense of thy spirit, the sound of thy song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad god of the north-east wind, whose heart is as high as the hands of thy kingdom are strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy kingdom whose empire is terror and joy, twin-featured and fruitful of births divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Days lit with the flame of the lamps of the flowers, and nights that are drunken with dew for wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sleep not for joy of the stars that deepen and quicken, a denser and fierier throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the world that thy breath bade whiten and tremble rejoices at heart as they strengthen and shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth gives thanks for the glory bequeathed her, and knows of thy reign that it wrought not wrong.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p><p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">VII</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy spirit is quenched not, albeit we behold not thy face in the crown of the steep sky's arch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bold first buds of the whin wax golden, and witness arise of the thorn and the larch:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild April, enkindled to laughter and storm by the kiss of the wildest of winds that blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls loud on his brother for witness; his hands that were laden with blossom are sprinkled with snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his lips breathe winter, and laugh, and relent; and the live woods feel not the frost's flame parch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the flame of the spring that consumes not but quickens is felt at the heart of the forest aglow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sparks that enkindled and fed it were strewn from the hands of the gods of the winds of March.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With English hunters at heel, till now is the herd of them past the Forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All huddled and hurtled seaward; and now need none wage war upon these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor huntsmen follow the quarry whose fall is the pastime sought of the seas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day upon day upon day confounds them, with measureless mists that swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With drift of rains everlasting and dense as the fumes of ascending hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The visions of priest and of prophet beholding his enemies bruised of his rod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld but the likeness of this that is fallen on the faithful, the friends of God.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span><span class="i0">Northward, and northward, and northward they stagger and shudder and swerve and flit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dismantled of masts and of yards, with sails by the fangs of the storm-wind split.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But north of the headland whose name is Wrath, by the wrath or the ruth of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are swept or sustained to the westward, and drive through the rollers aloof to the lee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some strive yet northward for Iceland, and perish: but some through the storm-hewn straits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sunder the Shetlands and Orkneys are borne of the breath which is God's or fate's:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some, by the dawn of September, at last give thanks as for stars that smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the winds have swept them to shelter and sight of the cliffs of a Catholic isle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though many the fierce rocks feed on, and many the merciless heretic slays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet some that have laboured to land with their treasure are trustful, and give God praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the kernes of murderous Ireland, athirst with a greed everlasting of blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unslakable ever with slaughter and spoil, rage down as a ravening flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slay and to flay of their shining apparel their brethren whom shipwreck spares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such faith and such mercy, such love and such manhood, such hands and such hearts are theirs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short shrift to her foes gives England, but shorter doth Ireland to friends; and worse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fare they that came with a blessing on treason than they that come with a curse.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span><span class="i0">Hacked, harried, and mangled of axes and skenes, three thousand naked and dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear witness of Catholic Ireland, what sons of what sires at her breasts are bred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winds are pitiful, waves are merciful, tempest and storm are kind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waters that smite may spare, and the thunder is deaf, and the lightning is blind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these perchance at his need may a man, though they know it not, yet find grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But grace, if another be hardened against him, he gets not at this man's face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his ear that hears and his eye that sees the wreck and the wail of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his heart that relents not within him, but hungers, are like as the wolf's in his den.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worthy are these to worship their master, the murderous Lord of lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath given to the pontiff his servant the keys of the pit and the keys of the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild famine and red-shod rapine are cruel, and bitter with blood are their feasts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fiercer than famine and redder than rapine the hands and the hearts of priests.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God, God bade these to the battle; and here, on a land by his servants trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They perish, a lordly blood-offering, subdued by the hands of the servants of God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These also were fed of his priests with faith, with the milk of his word and the wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These too are fulfilled with the spirit of darkness that guided their quest divine.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span><span class="i0">And here, cast up from the ravening sea on the mild land's merciful breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This comfort they find of their fellows in worship; this guerdon is theirs of their quest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death was captain, and doom was pilot, and darkness the chart of their way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night and hell had in charge and in keeping the host of the foes of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invincible, vanquished, impregnable, shattered, a sign to her foes of fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sign to the world and the stars of laughter, the fleet of the Lord lies here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, for none may declare the place of the ruin wherein she lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, for none hath beholden the grave whence never a ghost shall rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fleet of the foemen of England hath found not one but a thousand graves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he that shall number and name them shall number by name and by tale the waves.<br /></span>

<h2>A WORD WITH THE WIND</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lord of days and nights that hear thy word of wintry warning,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wind, whose feet are set on ways that none may tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Change the nest wherein thy wings are fledged for flight by morning,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Change the harbour whence at dawn thy sails are spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the dawn, ere yet the imprisoning night has half released her,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">More desires the sun's full face of cheer, than we,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well as yet we love the strength of the iron-tongued north-easter,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yearn for wind to meet us as we front the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All thy ways are good, O wind, and all the world should fester,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Were thy fourfold godhead quenched, or stilled thy strife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the waves and we desire too long the deep south-wester,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whence the waters quicken shoreward, clothed with life.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet the field not made for ploughing save of keels nor harrowing<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Save of storm-winds lies unbrightened by thy breath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Banded broad with ruddy samphire glow the sea-banks narrowing<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Westward, while the sea gleams chill and still as death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp and strange from inland sounds thy bitter note of battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Blown between grim skies and waters sullen-souled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the baffled seas bear back, rocks roar and shingles rattle,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Vexed and angered and anhungered and acold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Change thy note, and give the waves their will, and all the measure,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Full and perfect, of the music of their might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let it fill the bays with thunderous notes and throbs of pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shake the shores with passion, sound at once and smite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet are even the mild low notes of wind and sea, but sweeter<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sounds the song whose choral wrath of raging rhyme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bids the shelving shoals keep tune with storm's imperious metre,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bids the rocks and reefs respond in rapturous chime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet the lisp and lulling whisper and luxurious laughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Soft as love or sleep, of waves whereon the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreams, and dreams not of the darkling hours before nor after,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Winged with cloud whose wrath shall bid love's day be done.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet shall darkness bring the awakening sea a lordlier lover,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Clothed with strength more amorous and more strenuous will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence her heart of hearts shall kindle and her soul recover<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sense of love too keen to lie for love's sake still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let thy strong south-western music sound, and bid the billows<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Brighten, proud and glad to feel thy scourge and kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sting and soothe and sway them, bowed as aspens bend or willows,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet resurgent still in breathless rage of bliss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All to-day the slow sleek ripples hardly bear up shoreward,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Charged with sighs more light than laughter, faint and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a woodland lake's weak wavelets lightly lingering forward,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Soft and listless as the slumber-stricken air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be the sunshine bared or veiled, the sky superb or shrouded,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Still the waters, lax and languid, chafed and foiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keen and thwarted, pale and patient, clothed with fire or clouded,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Vex their heart in vain, or sleep like serpents coiled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee they look for, blind and baffled, wan with wrath and weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Blown for ever back by winds that rock the bird:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winds that seamews breast subdue the sea, and bid the dreary<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Waves be weak as hearts made sick with hope deferred.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span><span class="i0">Let thy clarion sound from westward, let the south bear token<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How the glories of thy godhead sound and shine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid the land rejoice to see the land-wind's broad wings broken,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bid the sea take comfort, bid the world be thine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half the world abhors thee beating back the sea, and blackening<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Heaven with fierce and woful change of fluctuant form:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the world acclaims thee shifting sail again, and slackening<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cloud by cloud the close-reefed cordage of the storm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeter fields and brighter woods and lordlier hills than waken<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here at sunrise never hailed the sun and thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn thee then, and give them comfort, shed like rain and shaken<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Far as foam that laughs and leaps along the sea.<br /></span>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
